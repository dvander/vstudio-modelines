vstudio-modelines
=================

# Usage
Visual Studio add-in to use VIM modelines. Only Visual Studio 2012 has been tested. Does not conflict with VsVim.

If any of the first 3 lines of a file contains:
   vim: set

Then the rest of the line is scanned for any occurrence of:
   ts=<n>    - Sets TabSize property.
   sw=<n>    - Sets IndentSize property.
   et        - Sets InsertTabs to false.
   noet      - Sets InsertTabs to true.

The line must end in a ':' as vim requires. Example:

  vim: set ts=4 sw=4 tw=99 noet :
